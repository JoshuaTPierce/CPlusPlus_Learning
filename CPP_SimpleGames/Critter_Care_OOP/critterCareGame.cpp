/* The Critter Caretaker game puts the player in charge of his own virtual pet. The
player is completely responsible for keeping the critter happy, which is no small
task. He can feed and play with the critter to keep it in a good mood. He can also
listen to the critter to learn how the critter is feeling, which can range from
happy to mad. */
