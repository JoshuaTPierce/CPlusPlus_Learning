The C++ library defines several classes that it uses to report problems encountered in
the functions in the standard library. These exception classes are also intended to be
used in the programs we write. These classes are defined in four headers:
    • The exception header defines the most general kind of exception class named
exception. It communicates only that an exception occurred but provides no
additional information.
    • The stdexcept header defines several general-purpose exception classes,
which are listed:

exception (the most general kind of problems)
runtime_error(problem that can be detected only at runtime)
range_error (run-time error, result generated outside the range of values that are meaningful)
overflow_error (runtime error: computation overflowed (infinite recursion, e.g.))
underflow_error (runtime error: computation underflowed)
logic_error (error in the logic of the program)
domain_error (logic error: argument for which no result exists)
invalid_argument (logic error: inappropriate argument)
length_error (logic error: attempt to create an object larger than the maximum size for that type)
out_of_range (logic error: used a value outside the valid range)
